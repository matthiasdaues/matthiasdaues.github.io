## problem

How can I use real citations and references to sources via bibtex / zotero in a markdown based github-pages workflow?

## context
 
I find it important to be thorough with sources but I don't want the actual referencing to hinder my workflow.

## solution

I haven't one yet. But there's some people doing amazing things. 
It will take some effort to make it work for me, though.
